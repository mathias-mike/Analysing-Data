# Data analysis workspcae 
This repo is basically the home of the 5 projects of the udacity data analyst nano degree course that I have completed. The projects are;
* Explore weather trends
* TMDB movie data analysis
* AB Testing on company webpage
* WeRateDogs Analysis
* Ford GoBike share system analysis

Each folder contains files related to the projects and a README.md file that gives a brief description of the project. The .ipynb files and the notebook file that contain each projects code and all analysis performd to gain insight form the given data.

Please feel free to peruze.
